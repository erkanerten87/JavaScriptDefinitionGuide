/* JS objects are composite values have properties had named values

   We refer the value of property using . notation.
   When the value of property is a function we call it a method.

   when accessing a property of string, number or boolean the temporary
   objects are created from this value and returning the result from
   object method.After that this temporary objects are discarded.
   so when u change a string length property you actually change
   tempoarary objects property and it will not persist on really one.

   We called this wrapper objects.
   So you must know that adding a property or setting a propery Ä±n
   string , number, boolean does not affect real type so they are
   read only...

   == operator treats a value and its wrapper object is equal
   === operator always use typeof so their type are different so they a
   are not equal.
